    *   Latin America's many political, economic, and social woes in the twentieth century made observers despair that non-violent, institutional reform would never succeed in resolving the region's problems. In at least three instances, in Mexico from 1910 to 1920, in Cuba in 1959, and in Nicaragua in 1979, socialist revolutionary approaches to political corruption, unequal distribution of wealth, and social inequality were attempted. Evaluate the successes (and/or failures) of these three revolutions in addressing long-term Latin American problems.  
          
        
    *   How viable has the nation-state been in Latin America during the twentieth century? In many places throughout the world in this period, the nation-state has promised to provide physical security for its people and their property, political rights for its citizens, and economic prosperity for all its residents. The nation-states of Latin America, however, have had notable problems in keeping these pledges. Discuss the reasons for their difficulties by looking at three of the following four examples: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, or Mexico.
